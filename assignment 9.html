								<P> A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of probelem.</P>
									<h5 align="left"> <a id="c2"> cpu </a> </h5>
									<p> A central processing unit (CPU) also referred to as a central processor unit,is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical, logical and input/output operations of the system. The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s. The form,design, and implementation of CPU'S have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operations remains much the same.</p><br>
										<h4 align="left"> <a id="c3"> Arithmetic logic unit</a></h4>
										<p>
											In computing, an arithmetic and logic unit(ALU) is a digital circuit that performs integer arithmetic and logical operations.The ALU is a fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer, and even the simplest  mmicroprocessors contain one for purposes such as maintaining timers. The processors found inside modern CPUs and graphics processing unit (GPUs) accomodate very powerful and very complex ALUs; a single component may contain a number of ALUs</p>
											<h1 align="left"> <a id="c4"> PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</a></h1>
											<p>A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.</p>
												<h4 align="left"> <a id="c5"> C </a></h4>
												<p>C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computers, from supercomputers to embedded systems</p>
												<h3 align="left"> <a id="c6"> C++</a></h3>
												<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.</p>
												<h1 align="left"><a id="c7"> DBMS</a></h1>
												<p>A database management system (DBMS) is a computer program (or more typically, a suite of them) designed to manage a database, a large set of structured data, and run operations on the data requested by numerous users. Typical examples of DBMS use include accounting, human resources and customer support systems.</p>
												<h2 align="left"> <a id="c8">RDBMS</a></h2>
												<p>A relational database is a digital database based on the relational model of data, as proposed by E. F. Codd in 1970.[1] A software system used to maintain relational databases is a relational database management system (RDBMS). Many relational database systems have an option of using the standard SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and maintaining the database.</p>
												<h3 align="left" ><a id="c9">OODBMS</a></h3>
												<p>Object-oriented database management systems (OODBMSs) also called ODBMS (Object Database Management System) combine database capabilities with object-oriented programming language capabilities. OODBMSs allow object-oriented programmers to develop the product, store them as objects, and replicate or modify existing objects to make new objects within the OODBMS. Because the database is integrated with the programming language, the programmer can maintain consistency within one environment, in that both the OODBMS and the programming language will use the same model of representation.</p>
												<h4 align="left" ><a id="c10">HDBMS</a></h4>
												<p>A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data are organized into a tree-like structure. The data are stored as records which are connected to one another through links. A record is a collection of fields, with each field containing only one value. The type of a record defines which fields the record contains.</p>
												<h5 align="left"> <a id="c11">NWDBMS</a></h5>
												<p>A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Where databases are more complex they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques. </p>
